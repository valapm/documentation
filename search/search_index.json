Vala is an open-source platform for peer-to-peer prediction markets running on Bitcoin SV. Is Vala trustless? Mostly. The correct state of Vala including every market, trade and oracle is enforced by Miners and can be deterministically generated from the current state of the blockchain. There is trust required in the oracles. See the Oracle FAQ for details. Is Vala censorship-resistant? Yes, to the degree that Bitcoin itself is censorship-resistant. Nobody can prevent you from broadcasting valid transactions to trade in markets or do anything else in Vala, except a majority of Bitcoins hashrate. While we could theoretically censor some transactions or fake information in our backend, there is nothing preventing you from broadcasting them directly or running your own backend. Is Vala open-source? Yes. All scripts and logic, the frontend and code used to generate transactions as well as the wallet are open-source and available on Github . At the moment, the only exception to this is our backend server who's only job is to collect and broadcast transactions and serve the current state of Vala.","title":"General"},{"location":"#valaai-documentation","text":"","title":"Vala.ai Documentation"},{"location":"#what-is-vala","text":"Vala is an open-source platform for peer-to-peer prediction markets running on Bitcoin SV.","title":"What is Vala?"},{"location":"#is-vala-trustless","text":"Mostly.

Liquidity funds provided to the LMSR market maker algorithm and are used to enable trades without sufficient opposing bets. Available liquidity corresponds to market depth and increased liquidity will lead to trades having less of an effect on market prices. How much will I earn as a liquidity provider? You will earn your share of collected market fees, equal to your contributed share to the markets liquidity. Your profit will depend on: Your share of total liquidity The markets liquidity fee The trading volume of the market Will I get my funds invested in liquidity back?

Prediction markets are betting markets that enable participants to trade and speculate on the probability of event outcomes. Through monetary incentives they aggregate information about the future, making it accessible to anybody. How do Markets work? All trades happen on-chain and are managed by an automated market maker implemented in Bitcoin Script, namely the logarithmic market scoring rule (LMSR). You can inspect the script code here When will a market resolve? Whenever the market Oracle decides to resolve it. The conditions of that can be layed out in the market details.","title":"Markets"},{"location":"faq/markets/#what-is-a-prediction-market","text":"Prediction markets are betting markets that enable participants to trade and speculate on the probability of event outcomes.

Whether you trust the owner of that domain to make the right choice or cheat and burn their reputation forever has to be your own determination. How are Oracles payed? When creating a market the Oracle can set a percentage fee that they will receive on all trade profits. What requirements are there to become an Oracle? A domain you are willing to publicly connect.
