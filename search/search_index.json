Vala is an open-source platform for peer-to-peer prediction markets running on Bitcoin SV. Is Vala trustless? Mostly. The correct state of Vala including every market, trade and oracle is enforced by Miners and can be deterministically generated from the current state of the blockchain. There is trust required in the oracles. See the Oracle FAQ for details. Is Vala censorship-resistant? Yes, to the degree that Bitcoin itself is censorship-resistant. Nobody can prevent you from broadcasting valid transactions to trade in markets or do anything else in Vala, except a majority of Bitcoins hashrate. While we could theoretically censor some transactions or fake information in our backend, there is nothing preventing you from broadcasting them directly or running your own backend. Is Vala open-source? Yes. All scripts and logic, the frontend and code used to generate transactions as well as the wallet are open-source and available on Github . The only exception to this is our backend-server who's only job is to collect and broadcast transactions and serve the current state of Vala.","title":"General"},{"location":"#valaai-documentation","text":"","title":"Vala.ai Documentation"},{"location":"#what-is-vala","text":"Vala is an open-source platform for peer-to-peer prediction markets running on Bitcoin SV.","title":"What is Vala?"},{"location":"#is-vala-trustless","text":"Mostly.

Prediction markets are betting markets that enable participants to trade and speculate on the probability of event outcomes.

Oracles create and resolve markets. Anybody can become an oracle. How can I trust a certain Oracle? The only power an Oracle has is to select one of the outcomes and resolve a market they created. Oracles have to verifiably connect a domain they own. All decisions an Oracle makes are embedded in the blockchain for everybody to see, forever. Whether you trust the owner of that domain to make the right choice or cheat and burn their reputation forever has to be your own determination. How are Oracles payed? When creating a market the Oracle can set a percentage fee that they will receive for all trade earnings. What requirements are there to become an Oracle? A domain you are willing to publicly connect. That's it. Can Vala prevent someone from becoming an oracle or creating markets? No. See here","title":"Oracles"},{"location":"faq/oracles/#what-is-an-oracle","text":"Oracles create and resolve markets.
