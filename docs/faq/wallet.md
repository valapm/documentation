## What if I lose my password?

You can always restore a wallet using your seed phrase.

## What if I lose my seed phrase?

If you still have your credentials you can log in and view your seed phrase.

## What if I forget my wallet ID?

The wallet IDs are deterministically generated from your wallet seed. You can restore a wallet using your seed phrase and it will generate the same wallet id again.
